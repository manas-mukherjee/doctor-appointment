# Doctor's appointment 

This repository has a very basic example of backend and frontend communication. The backend is written in Python using the Flask framework and the frontend is HTML with plain JavaScript.


## Set up project instruction 

Install the requirements for the backend by first creating a virtual environment in the backend directory:

```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
```
Then install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Startup instruction 

### Backend 

```
python app.py
```

### Frontend using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):

```
http-server
```

`http://localhost:8080`
